Julia reviewed the goals of the TAPAS grant:
1. Build and XML aware repository
2. Allow users to interact with XML data as XML data, not just a blob of data

Ashley is currently working with the XML data base (getting it up and running and getting it to recognize public and private items).
Ashley's next steps:
* Count how many elements appear in the corpus
* Make sure Hydra can communicate with eXist and tell it what it wants

Will is currently working on getting support files to make it into Hydra (just images, for now).
Will's next steps:
* Look at -ographies
* Set up the newly established verbs in Cerberus Core

We all agreed that there needs to be coordination between TAPAS team members working on/with Drupal. Julia will email the Drupal-oriented team members and Will will follow up with instructions/best practices/foundational information about working with Drupal.

# January 15, 2015

### Rough notes from Jim; Sarah will edit / revise / expand.

Review / Discussion of roles

Julia: Co-Director / XML, Searching, TEI component (works w/ Ashley and Syd) on 
Syd: TEI Specialist; what happens to TEI documents in TAPAS: what do we validate, how do we show them (reading interface)
Patrick: signed to TAPAS grant; broker institutional agreements / expertise in repository architecture
Sarah: added to grant: working on XSLT stylesheet to transfer metadata to MODS for repository
Eli: user interface 
Ashley: XML applications developer; cool things we can do with TEI documents; upgrading eXist
Ben: Project Manager; filter from front-end user to development team; better documenting various tasks and workflows; establishing better lines of communication (thing Ben mentioned)
Linda: new DRUPAL developer: digging through documentation left by old DRUPAL developer; working on data dictionary
Will: working on connection between DRUPAL and Hydra; built dev environment / virtual machine stuff

Scott Hamlin: project Co-Director at Wheaton (weekly phone calls between Ben, Julia, and Scott); TAPAS originator
Elliot Scott: original DRUPAL developer; in orbit to answer questions
Nathan Doyle: independent contractor doing DRUPAL work (remote / emergency basis); Nathan and Elliot have documented security updates
Karl: systems-level issue
David Cliff: out of the office / on grant

To-be-hired: data visualization person

Overview of areas to discuss this semester
1.distinct strands of work / workflow
2.systems: where things live, how they get updated; data management systems 3.communication mechanisms: where documentation has accumulated
4.project management issue: issue tracking systems

map of relations

Drupal: built first (content management system) in first grant: provides user environment where people can upload TEI data; create projects (organization-level entities); create collections within projects; manage data and configure how it will be displayed in reader interface
a simple environment for uploading, managing, and publishing TEI data

long-term curation of TEI data: use of Hydra, Fedora, eXist

in the future: we’d like to stop using Drupal: not the interface that we’d like to use
re-building TAPAS using Hydra and then allowing Drupal to wither: not in the scope of this grant and ambitious, so it may be the next grant; for current grant, thinking about opportunities where work might help facilitate transition without compromising current work

budgetary implications: coherent, single-page recommendation for architecture
need for a third full server or whether it can be done through a desktop application
come back in two weeks (end of January) to look at implications (instead of large VM, two small VMs); tied to need for “skunk works”

### Sarah's Notes:

General TAPAS Review Topics:
What are the groups and roles for the TAPAS group?
Systems and where things live? How do they get updated?
Communication mechanisms
Project management/issue tracking

Migrating Drupal to Hydra is outside the scope of this grant.

Questions:
* Drupal: Is there a deployment plan? Production and Development Drupal sites are not in sync. Proposed: need a third for testing work (sandbox)? Need a recommendation for new architecture (move to one large and two small VMs, rather than two large VMs and one small. (Patrick and Julia will need to consider the budget implications.)
* Where do VMs fit into the workflow? A vagrant instance runs Drupal, hydra, and eXist. This is the Plattr GitHub repository.

TAPAS project broad categories:
* Fedora/Hydra
* TEI
* XQuery/XML DB/eXist
* User interface
* Accounts/User Data/People management?
* Visualizations

What is being transferred between systems (represented in the graph)? Data, metadata, -ographies, etc. Who is working on these things? Who needs to be consulted?

Fedora/Hydra --> Drupal: Drupal upload process to Hydra; bilateral connection; where to generate the TFC and how to tackle that?
Drupal --> eXist: XQuery; data returned? is the relationship between files the same in Drupal and eXist?

Future Discussions:
* Deployment architecture and implementing Drupal Features (invite Ernesto). Eli will take a look at how difficult it would be to implement Features (https://www.drupal.org/project/features) in Drupal. 
* TAPAS Friendly Copy (TFC: TEI amended with TAPAS specific data.)
 * When is the TFC created? When TEI data is added to Drupal, but the TFC generation might be better done through Fedora. Where the TFC is generated will affect what eXist communicates with.
 * The original is kept, in addition to the TFC.
* eXist
 * How to mediate permissions: should go through Hydra, or should talk directly to eXist? eXist will return XML to Drupal.
 * How things are "unpacked"?
 * How will data be manipulated or visualized? Will eXist have to return XML and JSON? Should Drupal be doing the JSON transformation?
 * eXist needs its own GitHub repository? Figure out where eXist should live in the Library GitHub world.
